# SnowGem Masternode VPS Setup

This guide has been tested with an Ubuntu 16.04 VPS installation, for both the [20GB SSD, 512MB RAM, 500GB Bandwidth] and [25GB SSD, 1024MB RAM, 1000GB Bandwidth] options.

The setup assumes that your local pc, either Windows or Linux will run the wallet.  You will be able to view and enable/disable your masternode from there.  A VPS will also be used to host the SnowGem node with a synced blockchain for reliability and the convenience of not needing to have a dedicated local PC on continuously.

This guide will focus on the Linux VPS part.  For a graphical reference on setting up the local Windows wallet, check outâ€¦ https://snowgem.org/how-to-setup-a-masternode/

I have added steps that make your node more secure, safer than the default configuration, and a bit more convenient.  Those steps are optional, however, highly recommended.
